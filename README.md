# FocusFlow
FocusFlow is a productivity tool that combines task management with a built-in Pomodoro-style timer. Users can create, edit, and track tasks while focusing on one task at a time using timed work sessions. Tasks auto-update as completed when the timer ends, helping improve focus and workflow efficiency.
